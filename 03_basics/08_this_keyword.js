    console.log(`${this.username}, welcome to website`) //Somesh, welcome to website

//suppose I write username static in users object, and it will change if another users comes in place of username and change the username

users.username = "Samm" //here current context value will be change in object
users.greeting()//Samm, welcome to website


//what if i log this keyword alone here*************IMP******************
console.log(this); //{}
//Here we are using the node, and (this) refer to empty object which is current context, but in browser it show different 

//if we log (this) in browser it show different look like this
// WindowÂ {0: Window, 1: Window, 2: Window, 3: global, 4: global, window: Window, self: Window....
//it's because in earlier there is only one way to execute js inside browser, and engine also there,
// now we have to take engine outside like node, deno..now we have standalone engine

//and when we run engine inside browser so global object is called window object, that's why we captured window object, like click, formsubmit and all..
